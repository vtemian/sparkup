# Training observability — design handoff

**Status: not built here.** This design was researched and specified inside `sparkup`, then split
out when the scope was separated: `sparkup` provisions the box and gets metrics *into* Prometheus;
a separate project owns the training wrapper that emits per-run metrics and correlates them.

This file is the handoff. It is the research and the decisions, so the separate project starts from
a specification rather than from scratch. Nothing here is implemented.

## What the separate project has to build

A small wrapper around a training/fine-tuning round that exposes, per run:

- **training metrics** — epoch, step, loss, learning rate, grad-norm, tokens/sec, steps/sec
- **system metrics** — already provided by `sparkup` (CPU, load, unified memory, temperatures, GPU
  utilisation/power/clocks). The wrapper does not re-collect these; it correlates against them.
- **energy** — already provided by `sparkup` as a wall-socket series from the Shelly plug. The
  wrapper turns it into per-run energy and cost.

What `sparkup` guarantees it can rely on: a Prometheus at `127.0.0.1:9090` with the remote-write
receiver enabled, a Grafana at `http://spark.local` with a provisioned Prometheus datasource, and
live `node`, `gpu` and `power` scrape jobs.

## Phase C — training observability (the k6 part)

### C0: `/srv/bbm`
`/srv/bbm/{data,checkpoints,runs}`, group `bbm`, setgid so vlad and marius share artifacts.
**This exists because `rsync --delete` owns `~/bbm`.** Every training path points here.

### C1: `trainobs` — the Python package
Small, dependency-light, deployed to a venv on the box and importable by `bbm`'s future `train/`
module. `sparkup` owns it because it knows the Prometheus URL; `bbm` imports it.

Dependency: `prometheus-remote-writer` (v1.1.3, Jan 2026, Apache-2.0; small enough to vendor if
abandoned — the remote-write 1.0 protocol is frozen). On aarch64, `python-snappy` 0.7+ wraps
`cramjam` which ships manylinux aarch64 wheels — **verify a plain install before assuming**; fall
back to a ~50-line DIY protobuf+snappy writer if it fights.

`PrometheusCallback(TrainerCallback)` — structure copied from Axolotl, labels fixed:

- `on_train_begin` → the info metric plus the two timestamps that make everything else work:
  ```
  training_run_info{run_id, run_name, git_sha, model, dataset, tokenizer, status} 1
  training_run_start_timestamp_seconds{run_id}
  training_run_heartbeat_timestamp_seconds{run_id}
  ```
- `on_log` → `loss`, `learning_rate`, `grad_norm`, `epoch` from `logs`; `training_step` from
  `state.global_step`; `training_steps_per_sec` and `training_tokens_per_sec` derived from deltas
  of `global_step` / `num_input_tokens_seen` over `time.monotonic()` (needs
  `TrainingArguments(include_num_input_tokens_seen=True)`; it counts padding). Refresh the
  heartbeat every push.
- `on_train_end` → terminal status, so a dashboard distinguishes finished from crashed.
- Guard with `state.is_world_process_zero`; **wrap every push in try/except — a metrics outage must
  never kill a training run.** Batch pushes on a ~2–5 s cadence (k6 uses 5 s).

**The heartbeat is the trick.** It refreshes while the run lives and freezes when it dies, so one
link expression covers live and finished runs — no sentinel values, no "crashed and never wrote its
end time" hole.

Cardinality: **never put `step` in a label** — step is a gauge value, time is the axis. Metadata
lives on the info metric and joins in PromQL:
`training_loss{run_id=~"$run_id"} * on(run_id) group_left(run_name, git_sha) training_run_info`.

transformers 5.x: `TrainerCallback` signatures and `logs`/`TrainerState` fields are unchanged;
`report_to` now defaults to `"none"`; callback kwargs carry `processing_class`, not `tokenizer`.
Set `logging_steps=1` and `logging_first_step=True` for a live feel.

### C2: `sparkup-train` — the launcher
- `sparkup-train demo` — a **synthetic run** (decaying loss with noise, plausible step timing,
  realistic tokens/sec). `bbm` has no training code yet, so this is the acceptance test for the
  whole pipeline. It must be indistinguishable from a real run in Grafana.
- `sparkup-train run -- <command>` — mint a `run_id`, sample the idle power baseline (Phase D),
  export `run_id` + Prometheus URL into the environment, submit to the queue, record metadata
  under `/srv/bbm/runs/<run_id>/`, and on completion write `summary.json` and the per-run energy
  metrics.
- `run_id` format `run-YYYYmmdd-HHMM-<name>` so runs sort chronologically as strings.
- Print the deep link at launch (live form) and on completion (pinned form):
  ```
  http://spark.local/d/trainrun/training-run?orgId=1&var-run_id=<id>&from=<start_ms>&to=now&refresh=10s
  ```
  Subtract ~60 s from `start_ms` so the first datapoints are not glued to the axis. `&kiosk` must be
  bare. Optionally `POST /api/snapshots` at the end for runs worth keeping.
- **Annotations**: `POST /api/annotations` at start with tags `["training-run", "<run_id>"]`,
  `PATCH` with `timeEnd` at the end → a shaded region marking the run. Omit `dashboardUID` so the
  boundary also appears on infra dashboards — which is where you diagnose "why did throughput tank
  at 03:00". Persist the annotation id so a crash handler can still close the region.
- Keep the Trainer's own `log_history` JSON on disk. Prometheus is the live view; disk is the archive.

### C3: the "Training Runs" dashboard
Clone the k6 structure (dashboard 19665 defines `testid` as `label_values(...)`, `multi: true`,
every panel filtering on it):

- Variable `run_id` = `label_values(training_run_info, run_id)` — anchoring on the info metric is
  far cheaper than scanning every series. `multi: true`, `includeAll: false`, `refresh: 2`
  (re-query on time-range change), **`sort: 8`** (natural descending → newest first; 7/8 exist in
  the schema though the docs list only six).
- Panels: loss, lr, grad-norm, tokens/sec, steps/sec, legend `{{run_id}}`, matcher `=~` (multi-select
  interpolates to a regex). Stats for current step / max steps and latest loss.
- **GPU util, power, unified memory and wall power on the same dashboard.** This is the payoff of
  using the infra Grafana instead of a separate tracker: training curves next to the hardware.
- Annotation query filtered `["training-run", "$run_id"]`, `matchAny: false`. For compare mode add
  a second query with `matchAny: true` and just `["training-run"]`, since ANDing multiple run tags
  matches nothing.

### C4: runs index
A separate `/d/runs` dashboard: one Table panel, three **instant** queries in Table format —
`training_run_info`, `training_run_start_timestamp_seconds * 1000`,
`training_run_heartbeat_timestamp_seconds * 1000` — joined by `run_id` (outer), with an override on
the `run_id` field carrying two data links:

```
Follow live:       /d/trainrun/training-run?var-run_id=${__data.fields["run_id"]}&from=${__data.fields["start_ms"]}&to=now&refresh=10s
Full run (pinned): /d/trainrun/training-run?var-run_id=${__data.fields["run_id"]}&from=${__data.fields["start_ms"]}&to=${__data.fields["end_ms"]}
```

Add energy, duration and cost columns from Phase D. This is the experiment index — ~40 lines of JSON.
`${__data.fields["<name>"]}` pulls another column on the same row; timestamps must be **ms**, hence
the `* 1000` in PromQL rather than a transformation.

### C5: run comparison, honestly scoped
Multi-selecting `$run_id` gives wall-clock side-by-side — all the official k6 dashboards offer, and
enough for most needs. **A step-aligned overlay (loss-vs-step superimposed) is not natural in
Prometheus**; the axis is wall-clock. Options in order of sanity: (1) accept side-by-side — start
here; (2) `$run_a`/`$run_b` with PromQL `offset`, clunky; (3) the Comparison Panel plugin; (4) push
a rebased twin series with `out_of_order_time_window` set generously.

**If step-aligned overlay becomes daily bread rather than a nice-to-have, that is the one genuine
argument for a real experiment tracker instead of bending Prometheus.** Say so out loud rather than
building option 4 by default. Grafana's ceiling here is "watch a run, compare a few, correlate with
infra and power" — a real and valuable ceiling; know where it is. If this ever grows run-comparison
tables, hyperparameter diffing and artifact links, we have reinvented MLflow badly.

### C6: bbm-specific metrics (after stage 3 exists)
`verifier_pass_rate` and per-check failure counts from `bbm.verify.Report.failures` — **the stage-6
GRPO reward signal**, so watching it live is watching the reward. Plus corpus composition from
`stats.as_dict()`, draw-channel PAD fraction per batch (measured baseline 31.3% across the seven
fixtures, per-scene idle 21–48%), and the `stroke` degradation rate once stage 5 runs —
`bbm/PROMPT.md` calls that "the metric that matters".

### D2: the per-run energy series

Written by the launcher at run end, one sample per run, cheap to keep forever:

```
training_run_energy_wh{run_id}            total wall energy over the run   (plug)
training_run_energy_marginal_wh{run_id}   energy attributable to the run   (plug − idle)
training_run_gpu_energy_wh{run_id}        GPU-rail energy                  (NVML counter, exact)
training_run_idle_baseline_watts{run_id}  measured immediately before the run
training_run_duration_seconds{run_id}
training_run_cost{run_id}                 marginal Wh × tariff
```

`training_run_gpu_energy_wh` comes from `nvmlDeviceGetTotalEnergyConsumption` sampled at run start
and end — **verified working on this box** (10024 mJ / 3 s → 3.34 W, matching `PowerUsage` 3.38 W).
It is millijoules and **resets on driver reload**, so read it as a delta and discard the run's
figure if the counter went backwards. `nvidia-ml-py` is the client; it is now installed in
`~/bbm-train/.venv`.

The ratio `gpu_energy_wh / energy_wh` is the useful derived number: how much of what you paid for
was the GPU actually working, rather than the box merely being switched on. Under sustained load the
published wall-to-rail gap is around 2×, so **0.5 is roughly the ceiling, not the expectation** —
the ratio falls steeply as utilisation drops, because the rail collapses to a few watts while the
rest of the box does not. If a run scores far below 0.5, the bottleneck is not the GPU and more
epochs will mostly buy electricity.

**Two numbers, both wanted.** *Total* answers "what did this cost me". *Marginal* answers "was this
experiment worth it" — the box draws power whether or not you train. Measure the baseline for ~60 s
immediately before each run rather than assuming a global constant; it drifts with ambient
temperature and whatever else is running.

The PromQL, using the counter:

```promql
# exact Wh over the run window (dashboard: $__range == the pinned run window)
increase(shelly_energy_wh_total[$__range])

# marginal: subtract the idle baseline over the same duration
increase(shelly_energy_wh_total[$__range])
  - (avg_over_time(training_run_idle_baseline_watts[$__range]) * $__range_s / 3600)

# cost, tariff as a Grafana constant variable in currency per kWh
increase(shelly_energy_wh_total[$__range]) / 1000 * $tariff
```

Gauge fallback if the exporter lacks a counter — an approximation whose error scales with the
scrape interval, so say so in the panel description:

```promql
avg_over_time(shelly_power_watts[$__range]) * $__range_s / 3600   # Wh
```

**Tariff is a Grafana variable, not a hardcoded number** — it changes, and a variable means no
dashboard rebuild. Romania is roughly 1.3 RON/kWh at time of writing, so a continuous 200 W box is
on the order of €0.06/hour. **The interesting number is probably watt-hours per run, for comparing
efficiency between configs, more than the euros.**

**Clock discipline:** let Prometheus scrape the plug so all timestamps come from one clock. Never
trust the plug's own.

### D3: cost panels
Add energy, duration and cost columns to the runs index (C4), and a per-run stat row. The
comparison that justifies this whole phase is **final loss per watt-hour** across configs — put it
on the dashboard explicitly rather than leaving it as arithmetic for the reader.
